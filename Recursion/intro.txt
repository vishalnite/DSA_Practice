Recusrion: Recursion is when a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.
This condition is called base condition.

- In case of infinite recursion(without any base condition), it reaches a state called stack overflow.
- Visualize recursion using recursion tree (useful for debugging).

Backtracking: The actual work done by the function is after the recursive function call so that, the last function call's definition gets executed first.
It's basically the reverse of linear recursion.
