[NOTE] - Do not change the original number as done here. Instead make another variable called 'mask' and then do the required operation.

### Checking if a number is odd or even 

--> Use AND(&) operation with the number and 1.
    If (num & 1) is 1 then num is odd, otherwise it is even.
    The last bit of a number is always set therfore, it gives the desired solution.


### Setting a bit at the ith position in the number 'num'

--> Use OR(|) operation
    Left shift 1 by i (1 << i)
    num |= (1 << i)


### Unsetting a bit at the ith position in the number 'num'

--> Use AND(&) operation
    Left shift 1 by i (1 << i) and negate this value using (~)
    num &= (~(1 << i))


### Toggling a bit at the ith position in the number 'num'

--> Use XOR(^) operation
    Left shift 1 by i (1 << i)
    num ^= (1 << i)


### Checking if the bit at the ith position in the number 'num' is set or unset

--> Use AND(&) operation
    Left shift 1 by i (1 << i)
    num & (1 << i)
    The above operation returns a positive value if the bit is set, otherwise it returns 0.


### Stripping off the lowest set bit

--> use AND(&) operation
    num & (num - 1)
    This works because (num - 1) inverts all the bits till the lowest set bit including it and thus, doing (&) gives us the 
    desired result.


### Getting the position of the lowest set bit

--> use AND(&) operation
    num & (-num)
    (-num) is the 2's complement of a number and doing (&) with it gives us the desired result.
    We can easily check its validity through binary representation.


### Count the number of set bits in a number

--> Here we can run a loop till the number is 0
    If the num & 1 == 1 then increment the Count
    Left shift the number by 1

    count = 0
    while(num != 0) {
        if(num & 1 == 1)
            count++
        num = num >> 1
    }
    [It's T.C is O(Number of bits)]

    We can improve it slightly by counting only the lowest set bit of a number as we have done previously

    count = 0
    while(num != 0) {
        num = num & (num - 1)
        count++
    }
    [It's T.C. is O(number of set bits)
     but for number like 15(1111) both the methods gives the same T.C.]
