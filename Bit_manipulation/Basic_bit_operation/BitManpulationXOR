### Given a number N, find the XOR of all the numbers between 1 to N
[NOTE] - Do not use loop

--> Start finding XOR of numbers from 1 and doing that we will find a pattern in the answer.
    for example, 1 - 1
                 2 - 3
                 3 - 0
                 4 - 4
                 5 - 1
                 6 - 7
                 7 - 0
                 8 - 8
    This implies -- if(N % 4 == 0) then answer is N
                    if(N % 4 == 1) then answer is 1
                    if(N % 4 == 2) then answer is N + 1
                    if(N % 4 == 3) then answer is 0
    In this way we can find the answer, no matter how big the number is.
    By using a loop we obtain a time complexity of O(N) while, using this method 
    we obtain a time complexity of O(1).


### Find the XOR of all the numbers in the range (L - R)
[NOTE] - Required complexity O(1)

--> For example, we try to find the XOR of numbers between (3 - 6)
    Exapanding, we need to find (3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6)

    We can easily find the XOR of any number by the previous technique.
    XOR of 6 - (1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6)
    XOR of 2 - (1 ^ 2)

    If we do XOR between them then (1 ^ 2) cancels out and we get our desired result.
    So, the solution is (XOR(R)) ^ (XOR(L - 1))
