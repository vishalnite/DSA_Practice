### Given a number N, find the XOR of all the numbers between 1 to N
[NOTE] - Do not use loop

--> Start finding XOR of numbers from 1 and doing that we will find a pattern in the answer.
    for example, 1 - 1
                 2 - 3
                 3 - 0
                 4 - 4
                 5 - 1
                 6 - 7
                 7 - 0
                 8 - 8
    This implies -- if(N % 4 == 0) then answer is N
                    if(N % 4 == 1) then answer is 1
                    if(N % 4 == 2) then answer is N + 1
                    if(N % 4 == 3) then answer is 0
    In this way we can find the answer, no matter how big the number is.
    By using a loop we obtain a time complexity of O(N) while, using this method 
    we obtain a time complexity of O(1).
