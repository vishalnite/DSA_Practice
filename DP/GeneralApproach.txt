Typical question 
    - Count all ways
    - Minimize or Maximize 

How to approach any Dynamic Programming problem?
    - Represent in terms of indexes
    - Do all possible stuffs
    - Count all ways or find the best

Order of optimization 
-- Recursion solution -- Exponential
-- Memoization -- Linear with extra space -- Top-Down approach
-- Tabulation -- Bottom-Up approach
-- Space Optimization -- Whenever there is less variables then it can be always be space optimized
